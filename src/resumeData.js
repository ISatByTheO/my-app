    "aboutme":"I believe in socializing ideas. Team work thrives in an environment where folks feel confortable with open communication. This open-ness is a consequence of both, how surrounding peers percieve/react to new ideas, and, how these ideas are brought to life. As a technical lead, and an experienced developer, I believe this can be acheived by steering a peers intuition: Ask questions, and, Making colaborative efforts in both development and in some cases, a discover phase for technical requirements.
